# Troodon-V2 Stealthburner Specific Files

These files replace the stock stealthburner files and allow the use of stock toolhead PCB
The modified files for the PCB are taken from here https://github.com/MotorDynamicsLab/LDOVoron2/tree/main/STLs/LDOSBCW2MountCover/deprecated

## Files to choose

When printing the stealthburner files, the following should be chosen when there are multiple choice options

* chain_anchor_3hole.stl
* x_frame_V2TR_MGN12_left.stl
* x_frame_V2TR_MGN12_right.stl

The hotend is an E3D V6 clone, therefore the revo_six_and_v6 printhead parts should be used.
